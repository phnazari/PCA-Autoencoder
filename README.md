# Making a linear Autoencoder learn PCA

As shown in the Appendix of the paper **Geometric Autoencoders - What You See is What You Decode**, it can be shown that a **linear autoencoder** trained with weight-decay learns **PCA**.

This is a library which trains a lineat autoencoder with and without weight-decay and compares the results. See for example the following image:

From left to right one can see the embedding of MNIST into 2D latent space as done by a linear autoencoder trained only with MSE loss, by PCA and by a linear Autoencoder regularized via weight-decay.
